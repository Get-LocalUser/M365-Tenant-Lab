# M365-Tenant-Lab

*I don't have time to update this anymore..not like I have been anyway. I'll most likely just update the resources page 

Welcome to my M365 Dev Tenant! This space serves as a documentation hub for configs, experiments, and whatever else I want within my tenant, with a primary focus on Intune. I may expand to other areas over time.

> **Note:** This lab isn’t meant to be a comprehensive guide—it's just for fun and my own pleasure.

## Lab Philosophy

Over the years, I've kept my tenant uncluttered by removing most configurations after verifying their functionality. However, since I’m documenting these efforts, I might keep some items to showcase the things I create and test.
