## Things to Try or Implement
- [x] **Autopilot enrollment with user ESP disabled**
    - Success! Not only is the ESP much, much faster, but it's also a better experience overall, and the chance of failure to enroll is reduced!
- [x] **Disable first logon animation**
- [x] **Exclude break glass from CAP**
- [ ] **Setup Windows 11 Lab Deployment Kit from Microsoft**
- [ ] **Setup HybridCloudTrust**
- [x] **Enable Web Sign-In for Windows devices**
    - The goal here is to be able to have a user sign in using MS Authenticator only or TAP if needed.
    - It is enabled and I see the option but when I click on the web sign in button nothing happens. I think this is a VM issue and not a polciy issue.
    - Although this is cool WHfB seems to be better and quicker.
- [x] **Setup TAP and MFA for device enrollment**
- [x] **create Win32 and PS Script to launch Company Portal on new machine enrollment's first sign in**
    - This worked wth? HAHA. Was totally expecting it not to work especially since I had GPT make it with minimal changes. Will upload scripts. 
    - Although I will need to change the path as once Company Portal updates the folde path shoud reflect new version in name.
