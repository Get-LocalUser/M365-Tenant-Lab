## Things to try or implement
1. Autopilot enrollment with user ESP disabled.
2. Disable first logon animation


## Findings/update  
1. Success! not only is the ESP much much faster it's just a better experience overall and the chance of failure to enroll is reduced! 
2. Didn't work. Need to check the config again
