# Overview

I was tired of manually entering and authenticating with a username and password when using `Get-WindowsAutopilotInfo` script, so I created an **app registration** in **Entra ID** to stop this nonsense. I kept getting the API permissions wrong but thanks to [Andrew Taylor's blog](https://andrewstaylor.com/2023/06/13/authenticating-to-new-get-windowsautopilotinfo/) and a few other resources I was able to get it setup..I think! time to test once I get this next VM up.
